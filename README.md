# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: SQL Project  
**Database**: `retail_sales`

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to gain practical insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The work involves designing a structured database, preparing the data for analysis, and writing targeted SQL queries to answer real business questions. Through this project, I worked with transactional retail data that includes customer demographics, product categories, purchase quantities, pricing, and time-based sales information. The goal was to strengthen my SQL querying skills while learning how to translate raw sales data into meaningful insights.

## Objectives

- Create and structure a retail sales database  
- Clean and validate the dataset to ensure accuracy  
- Explore the data to understand its composition and patterns  
- Analyze sales performance and customer behavior using SQL  

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

The project begins with setting up a dedicated database and creating a retail sales table to store transactional data. The table is designed to capture key details such as transaction timestamps, customer information, product categories, quantities sold, cost metrics, and total sales values. This structure supports both exploratory analysis and business-focused queries.

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Initial exploration was performed to understand the size and quality of the dataset. This included reviewing total records, identifying unique customers, and examining available product categories. A thorough check for missing or null values was conducted, and incomplete records were removed to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable for analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis & Key Questions

Using SQL, I analyzed the dataset to answer business-relevant questions such as:

- Reviewing sales activity for specific dates  
- Filtering transactions by product category, quantity, and time period  
- Calculating total and average sales across categories  
- Analyzing customer age patterns within specific product groups  
- Identifying high-value transactions  
- Examining sales distribution by gender and category  
- Determining the strongest sales months within each year  
- Identifying top customers based on total spending  
- Measuring customer reach across different product categories  
- Classifying orders into time-based shifts to analyze purchasing behavior throughout the day  

## Findings

- **Customer Patterns**: Sales are distributed across multiple age groups and product categories, with noticeable variation in purchasing behavior  
- **Revenue Insights**: A subset of transactions contributes significantly to overall revenue through high-value purchases  
- **Time-Based Trends**: Monthly and hourly analysis reveals clear patterns in peak sales periods  
- **Customer Contribution**: A small group of customers accounts for a large portion of total sales, highlighting repeat and high-spending buyers  

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in designing a relational database, cleaning real-world retail data, and writing SQL queries to extract actionable insights. I improved my ability to analyze sales trends over time, segment customers based on behavior and demographics, and evaluate product performance using aggregated metrics. This project helped reinforce how SQL can be used not just for querying data, but for understanding business performance and supporting data-driven decision making.
